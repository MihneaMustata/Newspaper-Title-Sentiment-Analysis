In this project, we are going to use Python to extract news articles titles, from www.financiarul.ro, www.zf.ro and www.digi24.ro, label them as positive, neutral or negative (sentiment), and finally train and deploy a Machine Learning algorithm (Naive Bayes) that can label any given title, with a certain accuracy and precision score. The language used will be Romanian.
